# T20_Cricket_Pakistan_Visualization
A Data Science Project


In this project, I used pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot to clean and then plot two different datasets, showing Pakistan's cricket team's performance in 2018 and 2019 respectively (based on wins and losses in that specific year). My kernel density estimation plot showed that Pakistan's performance dropped in 2019, as compared to 2018.
